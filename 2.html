                    <p> In an object-oriented system, all data is represented as discrete objects with which the user and other objects may interact. An object-oriented system allows the user to focus completely on tasks rather than tools.Examples of object-oriented programming languages include C++ and Smalltalk.</p>

                    <img src="./pics/DBMS.jpg">
                    <p>The database management system (DBMS) is the software that interacts with end users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze the data. The DBMS software additionally encompasses the core facilities provided to administer the database. The sum total of the database, the DBMS and the associated applications can be referred to as a "database system". Often the term "database" is also used to loosely refer to any of the DBMS, the database system or an application associated with the database.</p>

                    <img src="./pics/DS.jpg">
                    <p>In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.</p>
